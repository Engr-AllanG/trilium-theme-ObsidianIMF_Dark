*These older themes might be broken on newer versions of Trilium*

# Theme Neon_Dark
This is a theme for [trilium](https://github.com/zadam/trilium).
In v3 I chaned the check list text to orange color. I changed primary font to Baskerville. Some other minor tweaks

It is compatable starting with trilium 0.43.3. It will likely function with previous versions

## Notes
See [here](https://github.com/zadam/trilium/wiki/Themes) for installation instructions. You need to add an attribute of type Label with name appTheme and no value. After setting the attribute, you need to select the theme in options. You may need to re-load the front end (ctrl-r).

## Issues
Switching to another theme does not work entirely without removing the appTheme attribute. I don't know why.
